# Read-List
>A full-stack application that uses Express, MySQL, and Express-handlebars to keep a database of books you'd like to read, as well as books you've read.

## Reading is fun!
>Enter the title and author of a book you'd like to read, and when you click **submit** it will appear in the **Books to Read** list.
Once you've finished the book, click the **READ IT!** button to send it to the **Books Completed** list.
All your books, both read and unread, are stored in a MySQL database.
